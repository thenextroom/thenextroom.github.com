<h1 id="the-next-room">The Next Room</h1>
<p><em>Inspired by the poem, "Death is Nothing at All", by Henry Scott Holland.</em>   </p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The last three years have been punctuated by events which have brought into clear focus the beautiful and finite resource we call <em>our lives</em>. The death of my mother in 2014, the birth of my child in 2015, and the death of my father in 2016.<br />
It’s heart breaking to watch the diagnosis, stoic treatment, and eventual decline of your previously healthy and ever present parents.<br />
There are so many roles we may carry as events unfold. These can include the role of patient, carer, advocate, parent, sibling, child, relative, night watchman, colleague, friend, power of attorney, diplomat, taxi, communications hub, event planner,  cat herder, etc.<br />
One thing is for certain: as a society, we don’t do death very well.<br />
Without being prescriptive (and recognising all the usual caveats around different perspectives and different personal situations), I see this website as a place to pull together some ideas that might help. Not only to better cope; but to draw out as many beautiful and rich experiences which really <em>do</em> exist, despite the possibility of seemingly insurmountable hardship and challenges, in the midst of our inevitable decline, or that of our loved ones.  </p>
<h2 id="death-is-nothing-at-all">Death is Nothing at All</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Death is nothing at all.<br />
It does not count.<br />
I have only slipped away into the next room.<br />
Nothing has happened.<br />
Everything remains exactly as it was.<br />
I am I, and you are you,<br />
and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged.<br />
Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.<br />
Call me by the old familiar name.<br />
Speak of me in the easy way which you always used.<br />
Put no difference into your tone.<br />
Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.<br />
Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.<br />
Play, smile, think of me, pray for me.<br />
Let my name be ever the household word that it always was.<br />
Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it.<br />
Life means all that it ever meant.<br />
It is the same as it ever was.<br />
There is absolute and unbroken continuity.<br />
What is this death but a negligible accident?<br />
Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight?<br />
I am but waiting for you, for an interval, somewhere very near, just round the corner.<br />
All is well.    </p>
<p><em>Henry Scott Holland</em>  </p>
