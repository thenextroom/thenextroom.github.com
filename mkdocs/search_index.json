The death of my mother in 2014, the birth of my child in 2015, and the death of my father in 2016.  \n\n\nIt\u2019s heart breaking to watch the diagnosis, stoic treatment, and eventual decline of your previously healthy and ever present parents.  \n\n\nThere are so many roles that each of us may carry as events unfold. These might include the role of patient, carer, advocate, parent, sibling, child, relative, night watchman, colleague, friend, power of attorney, diplomat, taxi, communications hub, event planner,  cat herder, etc.  \n\n\nOne thing is for certain: as a society, we don\u2019t do death very well.  \n\n\nWithout being prescriptive (and recognising all the usual caveats around different perspectives and different personal situations), I see this website as a place to pull together some ideas that might help. Not only to better cope; but to draw out as many beautiful and rich experiences which really \ndo\n exist, despite the possibility of seemingly insurmountable hardship and challenges, in the midst of our inevitable decline, or that of our loved ones.  \n\n\nDeath is Nothing at All\n\n\n\n\nDeath is nothing at all.\n\nIt does not count.\n\nI have only slipped away into the next room.\n\nNothing has happened.\n\nEverything remains exactly as it was.\n\nI am I, and you are you,\n\nand the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged.\n\nWhatever we were to each other, that we are still.\n\nCall me by the old familiar name.\n\nSpeak of me in the easy way which you always used.\n\nPut no difference into your tone.\n\nWear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.\n\nLaugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.\n\nPlay, smile, think of me, pray for me.\n\nLet my name be ever the household word that it always was.\n\nLet it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it.\n\nLife means all that it ever meant.\n\nIt is the same as it ever was.\n\nThere is absolute and unbroken continuity.\n\nWhat is this death but a negligible accident?\n\nWhy should I be out of mind because I am out of sight?\n\nI am but waiting for you, for an interval, somewhere very near, just round the corner.\n\nAll is well.    \n\n\nHenry Scott Holland",
